# ChildInsight — Intelligent Learning & Development Guidance System

> **Observe. Understand. Guide.**

ChildInsight is an educational platform designed to observe children's interactions with educational activities (choice, response accuracy, duration, attempts, hint engagement) and convert that data into understandable, explainable learning profiles and tailored recommendations for parents and educators.

---

### 🛡️ Ethical Mandate & Responsible-Use Notice (PRD §4)

- **Non-Diagnostic:** ChildInsight does **not** diagnose, label, or classify a child medically or psychologically. It does not output medical categorizations, psychiatric indicators, or developmental disorder labels.
- **Explainable Guidance:** All recommendations display human-readable educational rationales (e.g. *"Demonstrated 85% accuracy in beginner visual puzzles; ready for multi-step pattern matching"*).
- **Non-Comparative:** Classroom and teacher views strictly celebrate individual growth. There are **zero cross-student rankings, leaderboards, or score comparisons**.
- **Strength-Based Framing:** Profiles emphasize what children do well and where additional supportive practice can build confidence.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart & Setup Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python:** 3.11 or higher
- **Git**
- **pip** and **virtualenv**

### 2. Clone and Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/childinsight.git
cd ChildInsight

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux / macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to create your local `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
*(By default, `.env` is configured to use local SQLite with development settings — zero additional database setup required).*

### 4. Run Database Migrations
Apply all schema revisions (users, children, activities, questions, sessions, events, recommendations, audit logs):
```bash
python -m flask --app run.py db upgrade
```

### 5. Seed Demo Data
Pre-load a complete educational environment with 5 categories, 115 interactive activities, 415 questions, demo users across all roles, 3 children, 18 realistic activity sessions, trained K-Means pattern clustering, and tailored recommendations:
```bash
python -m flask --app run.py seed-demo
```
*(All seeded demo entities are clearly marked with a `Demo Data` badge throughout the parent, teacher, and child user interfaces).*

### 6. Run the Development Server
```bash
python run.py
```
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your web browser.

---

## 🔑 Demo Login Accounts

After running `python -m flask --app run.py seed-demo`, you can log into any portal using the following verified credentials:

| Role | Email Address | Password | Portal Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Platform Admin** | `admin@childinsight.demo` | `DemoPass123!` | System metrics, user management, educator assignment, security audit logs |
| **Educator / Teacher** | `teacher@childinsight.demo` | `DemoPass123!` | Student roster, individual growth profiles, class-wide aggregates (strictly unranked) |
| **Parent / Guardian** | `parent@childinsight.demo` | `DemoPass123!` | Performance cards, trend charts, tailored recommendations, PDF/CSV reports |

*To test the child play experience, log in as Parent Jordan and launch any activity from the dashboard, or navigate directly to `/child/select-child`.*

### 🔑 Password Reset & Demo Mode
ChildInsight includes a secure "Forgot Password" workflow adhering to zero user enumeration principles:
- Accessible via the **"Forgot password?"** link on the login page (`/login` or directly at `/forgot-password`).
- Submitting any email produces the same neutral confirmation message (*"If an account exists for this email address, password reset instructions have been generated."*) to prevent user enumeration attacks.
- **Demo Mode (Simulated Email Delivery)**: Because no SMTP server is configured in local development/demo environments, entering a registered email (e.g., `parent@childinsight.demo`) creates a secure 30-minute token, logs the link in the server log, and presents an amber callout box directly on-screen with the reset link.
- Reset tokens are single-use, expire after 30 minutes, and are stored hashed (SHA-256) in the `password_reset_tokens` table.

## 🌐 Multilingual Architecture & Language Support (i18n)

ChildInsight features a lightweight, robust internationalization (i18n) system that directly connects a child's **Preferred Language** profile setting to their learning experience in the Child Activity Zone (`/child/*`).

### Supported vs. Coming Soon Languages

| Language | Code | Support Status | Experience |
|---|---|---|---|
| **English** | `en` | **Fully Supported** | Full UI, activity prompts, questions, options, hints, and feedback in English. |
| **Hindi** | `hi` | **Fully Supported** | Full UI, category domains, seed activities, randomized options, hints, praise, and feedback in Hindi (Devanagari). |
| **Spanish** | `es` | *Coming Soon* | Selectable in child profile dropdown with `(Coming Soon)`. Gracefully falls back to English. |
| **French** | `fr` | *Coming Soon* | Selectable in child profile dropdown with `(Coming Soon)`. Gracefully falls back to English. |
| **German** | `de` | *Coming Soon* | Selectable in child profile dropdown with `(Coming Soon)`. Gracefully falls back to English. |
| **Mandarin** | `zh` | *Coming Soon* | Selectable in child profile dropdown with `(Coming Soon)`. Gracefully falls back to English. |

> **Graceful Fallback:** If a Hindi-preferred child encounters an activity that has not yet been translated, the activity content renders in English with a gentle notice banner:
> *🌐 अंग्रेजी में दिखाया जा रहा है — हिंदी संस्करण जल्द ही आ रहा है* (*"Showing in English — Hindi version coming soon"*).

---

### How Content Translations Are Stored

Translations are stored alongside original activity records using SQLite/PostgreSQL-compatible JSON columns:

1. **`activities.translations_json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "hi": {
       "title": "रंग मिलाओ साहसिक खोज [Demo Data]",
       "description": "जादुई रंगों को मिलाने और प्रकृति में आकृतियों को पहचानने में चित्रकार की मदद करें!"
     }
   }
   ```
2. **`activity_questions.translations_json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "hi": {
       "question_text": "जब आप चमकीले पीले और लाल रंग को एक साथ मिलाते हैं, तो कौन सा जादुई नया रंग बनता है?",
       "options": ["नारंगी", "नीला", "हरा", "बैंगनी"],
       "answer": "नारंगी",
       "hint": "एक रसीले संतरे या कद्दू के बारे में सोचें!"
     }
   }
   ```

### Dynamic Model Getters

Model helper methods automatically resolve the child's active language with fallback to English:
- `activity.get_title(lang)`: Returns translated title or default English title.
- `activity.get_description(lang)`: Returns translated description or default English description.
- `activity.has_translation(lang)`: Checks if a translation payload exists for the target language.
- `question.get_question_text(lang)`: Returns translated question prompt.
- `question.get_options(lang)`: Returns translated list of answer options.
- `question.get_shuffled_options(lang)`: Returns randomized translated options for display.
- `question.get_correct_answer(lang)`: Returns translated correct answer for evaluation.
- `question.get_hint(lang)`: Returns translated learning hint.

---

### How to Add a New Language

To introduce full support for a new language (e.g., Spanish `es`):

1. **Add Translation Dictionary**:
   Create `app/translations/es.py` defining the UI dictionary `TRANSLATIONS`:
   ```python
   TRANSLATIONS = {
       'explore': 'Explorar →',
       'play_now': 'Jugar Ahora →',
       'back_to_categories': '← Volver a Categorías',
       'lets_learn_play': '¡Vamos a Aprender y Jugar!',
       ...
   }
   ```
2. **Register Language in `app/translations/__init__.py`**:
   - Move `'es': 'Spanish'` from `COMING_SOON_LANGUAGES` to `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`.
   - Update `normalize_language()` to map `'es'`, `'spanish'`, `'español'` to `'es'`.
   - Update `get_translations()` to return `ES_TRANSLATIONS` when `lang == 'es'`.
3. **Update Child Form Dropdown (`app/forms/child.py`)**:
   Remove `(Coming Soon)` from the choice label: `('Spanish', 'Spanish')`.
4. **Seed Content Translations**:
   Populate `translations_json` with `"es"` payloads on target activities and questions.

## 🤝 Parent-Initiated Teacher Access & Dual Educator Architecture

ChildInsight features a dual-channel educator access architecture designed to balance institutional administration with parent-directed learning support:

```
Institutional Channel (Top-Down)       Parent-Directed Channel (Bottom-Up)
┌────────────────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  Platform Admin / School Lead   │     │  Parent / Primary Guardian     │
│  (/admin/assignments)          │     │  (/parent/children/<id>#share) │
└───────────────┬────────────────┘     └───────────────┬────────────────┘
                │                                      │
                ▼                                      ▼
     [teacher_assignments]                   [child_teacher_access]
      Status: Permanent admin pairing         Status: pending → active / declined / revoked
                │                                      │
                └───────────────────┬──────────────────┘
                                    ▼
                 Unified Educator Access Layer
                 - @child_access_required(write=False)
                 - Classroom Roster & Dashboard
                 - Full Progress Reports (PDF / CSV)
                 - Tailored Activity Assignments
```

### How Parent-Initiated Access Differs From & Coexists With Admin Assignments

| Dimension | Admin-Managed Assignments (`teacher_assignments`) | Parent-Initiated Access (`child_teacher_access`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Initiator** | Platform Administrator or School Operator | Parent / Primary Guardian |
| **Use Case** | Institutional classroom assignments (homeroom teachers, school terms) | Tutoring, after-school educators, external specialists, or parent-chosen teachers |
| **Consent Model** | Administrative directive (immediate access upon creation) | **Explicit Teacher Consent Required**: Teacher receives pending invite and must click **Accept** before viewing student data |
| **Revocation** | Removed by Platform Admin | Revocable at any time by the **Parent** or by the **Platform Admin** (instant HTTP 403 enforcement) |
| **Multiplicity** | Multiple teachers per child, multiple students per teacher | Multiple teachers per child, multiple students per teacher (zero artificial limits) |
| **Coexistence** | Evaluated via boolean OR: a teacher gains access if an active record exists in **either** system |

### Key Feature Workflows

1. **Child Card Direct Quick Action**:
   - On the parent's child list screen (`/parent/children`), each child card features a **"Share with Teacher"** button directly alongside "View Profile" and "Edit".
   - Clicking the button jumps directly to the `#share-with-teacher` flow for that specific learner without having to manually locate the section.
   - Styled consistently (`btn btn-outline btn-sm`) and configured with responsive flex-wrapping (`flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 0.5rem;`) so buttons wrap cleanly on mobile screens without card distortion.
2. **Parent Invite Flow & Anti-Enumeration Protection**:
   - Parents invite an educator by entering their email address in the child detail page.
   - **Zero Account Enumeration**: If the email does not correspond to an active teacher account, the system outputs: *"No active teacher account found with this email."* It strictly avoids disclosing whether the email exists under a different role (e.g. parent or child).
   - **Anti-Spam Rate-Limiting**: Duplicate pending requests for the same child-teacher pair are blocked with an informative prompt.
3. **Teacher Consent & In-Dashboard Requests**:
   - The teacher's dashboard displays a dedicated **"Pending Student Access Requests"** card highlighting requests (*"Parent Alice has requested you view Leo's report"*).
   - **Accept**: Moves grant status to `active`, registers student in teacher's roster, and notifies the parent.
   - **Decline**: Moves grant status to `declined`, notifies parent, and grants zero student access.
4. **Administrative Oversight & Transparency**:
   - The Admin Assignments page (`/admin/assignments#parent-grants` or `/admin/teacher-access`) provides platform-wide transparency over all active, pending, declined, and revoked parent grants.
   - Administrators can review the audit history and revoke any grant if necessary with full audit tracing.
5. **Security & Audit Logging**:
   - Every lifecycle event (`parent_grant_teacher_access_invite`, `teacher_accept_access_request`, `teacher_decline_access_request`, `parent_revoke_teacher_access`, `admin_revoke_parent_teacher_access`) writes an immutable record to `audit_logs`.
   - Revocation takes effect immediately at the database query and decorator level (`@child_access_required`), instantly barring the educator from student reports and analytics endpoints.

- 📄 **Sample PDF Progress Report**: [`docs/sample-report.pdf`](docs/sample-report.pdf) — Professional, printable multi-section report compiled with ReportLab (`reportlab.rl_config.pageCompression = 0`) featuring:
  - Learner profile metadata (name, age, grade, language)
  - Overall analytics summary (accuracy, completion rate, consistency score, engagement index, composite score)
  - Machine learning interaction pattern observation (K-Means cluster mapping)
  - Category breakdown across all 5 cognitive domains
  - Detailed chronological session log with duration, attempts, and accuracy
  - Tailored, explainable recommendations (priority, activity title, level-up/reinforce reason)
  - PRD §4 mandatory ethical responsible-use disclaimer
- 📈 **Sample CSV Data Export**: [`docs/sample-report.csv`](docs/sample-report.csv) — Structured comma-separated export suitable for spreadsheet tools (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) or educational data pipelines containing all profile attributes, metrics, session history, and recommendations.

## 🤖 Internal System Agents & Platform Health

ChildInsight incorporates an internal agent layer under `app/agent/` designed to keep the platform reliable, ethically compliant, and self-maintaining without manual administrator intervention.

> [!NOTE]
> **Architecture & Transparency Disclosure**: ChildInsight's internal agents are **deterministic rule-based monitors, schema validators, and scheduled machine learning pipelines** working in coordination. They do not claim or constitute Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), autonomous self-awareness, or black-box clinical decision-making.

### 1. Safety & Compliance Agent (`compliance_agent.py`)
- **What it does:** Acts as an ethical language sentinel. Scans every generated recommendation reason, notification alert, and exported report before it is saved or sent to parents and teachers.
- **Why it matters:** PRD §4 strictly bans clinical and diagnostic terminology (such as *ADHD*, *autism*, *dyslexia*, *deficit*, *disorder*, or *IQ scores*). If any prohibited term is detected, the agent immediately blocks the text, logs the incident for administrative review, and automatically substitutes an encouraging, strengths-based educational fallback.
- **Privacy Safeguard:** To protect learner confidentiality, raw blocked text is stored exclusively in secure server-side rotating logs—the administrator dashboard displays only matched rule categories and incident counts.

### 2. Content Integrity Agent (`content_integrity_agent.py`)
- **What it does:** Continuously audits the educational catalog for content anomalies, including activities with zero questions, empty categories, orphaned questions, invalid difficulty levels, out-of-range age bounds (`min_age > max_age`), and duplicate questions within an activity.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures children never encounter unplayable activities, broken questions, or inappropriate difficulty levels during their learning sessions.

### 3. Platform Health Agent (`health_agent.py`)
- **What it does:** Aggregates real platform telemetry to compute an objective 0–100 overall platform health score based on session completion rates (35%), valid content coverage (35%), recommendation coverage (30%), with deductions for recent compliance incidents and content integrity issues.
- **Why it matters:** Records snapshots in the `health_snapshots` database table so administrators can monitor health trends over time via an interactive Chart.js trend line rather than viewing an isolated static number.

### 4. Adaptive Content Suggestion Agent (`content_suggestion_agent.py`)
- **What it does:** Analyzes aggregate learner demographics (`Child.age`), category performance, gap persistence, and engagement trends (`analytics_service.compute_category_age_band_engagement_trend`) to automatically detect educational catalog gaps:
  - **Progression Gaps:** Identifies categories where learners cluster at a difficulty level with high mastery (accuracy $\ge 70\%$), but the subsequent tier lacks activities.
  - **Age Coverage Gaps:** Identifies active age bands on the platform (4–6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–14) that have fewer than 2 activities in a category.
  - **Content Imbalance:** Identifies categories with activity counts substantially lower than the platform average.
  - **Domain Expansion:** Identifies opportunities for new educational categories when active learners demonstrate high cross-domain engagement.
- **Rich Context & Evidence-Dense Reasoning:**
  - **Actively Affected Children Count:** Determines the exact number of active learners impacted by the gap rather than using generic descriptions.
  - **Gap Persistence Tracking:** Compares against previous pending suggestions to track how many scheduler cycles the gap has persisted across (`persistence_count`), updating dynamic metrics without creating duplicate rows.
  - **Engagement Trend Analysis:** Pulls category and cohort engagement trends (`improving`, `declining`, `steady`) from `analytics_service`.
  - **Evidence-Dense Reason Strings:** Generates transparent, data-backed reasons (e.g., *"14 children aged 9-12 are averaging 82% accuracy in Medium Logic with steady engagement, but only 1 Advanced activity available — this gap has persisted for 3 scheduler runs"*).
- **Urgency-Based Prioritization (`priority_score`):**
  - Computes an objective urgency score: $\text{priority\_score} = (\text{affected\_children} \times 2.0) + (\text{persistence\_count} \times 5.0) + (\text{trend\_penalty})$.
  - Admin suggestions dashboard (`/admin/content-suggestions`) displays priority and persistence badges and automatically sorts entries by `priority_score` descending so high-impact bottlenecks surface first.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Safeguard:** The agent **never auto-creates or auto-publishes content**. Suggestions are persisted in `content_suggestions` (`pending` status) with full educational evidence.
- **Admin Review Workflow:** Administrators review suggestions at `/admin/content-suggestions` and can click **"Draft with AI →"** (opening the pre-filled AI content drafting generator), **"Create Activity →"**, or **"Create Category →"** to pre-fill standard administrative forms, automatically marking the suggestion as `approved` upon publication, or **"Dismiss"** suggestions with zero action taken.

### 5. AI-Assisted Content Drafting Agent (`content_draft_agent.py`)
- **What it does:** Generates high-quality, research-grounded educational activity drafts for administrators using rich platform context:
  - **Category Style Grounding:** Analyzes existing activities in the target category as tone and question style benchmarks.
  - **Age-Band Calibration:** Inspects cross-category activities across all 5 cognitive domains for the target developmental cohort (4–6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–14) to match established vocabulary complexity and cognitive load.
  - **Curriculum Gap Targeting:** Directly incorporates data-backed gap detection reasoning from linked Content Suggestions so drafts solve genuine platform shortages rather than generic topics.
  - **Dual-Layer Ethical Compliance:** Passes PRD §4 clinical/diagnostic blacklist terms (`adhd`, `autism`, `deficit`, `disorder`, `iq`, etc.) as explicit negative generation constraints in the prompt, and subsequently validates every generated question through `compliance_agent.check_text()`, retrying up to 2 times and discarding any question that fails before human presentation.
- **Strict Human-in-the-Loop Boundary:** The agent **never auto-publishes or writes directly to the database**. This boundary does not change no matter how much platform context the agent has access to. All generated drafts are presented in an editable review screen (`/admin/activities/ai-draft/generate`) displaying transparent grounding metadata ("Matched tone from...", "Calibrated against...", "Addressing gap..."). Content is only committed to the database when an administrator explicitly clicks **"Approve & Publish"**, while clicking **"Discard"** throws the draft away.

### 6. Background Maintenance Runner (`scheduler.py`)
- **What it does:** An idempotent, fault-isolated pipeline runner (callable via CLI with `python -m flask run-agents` or triggered from the Admin Console) that systematically:
  1. Refreshes category progress aggregations for active learners.
  2. Refits the Scikit-learn K-Means interaction clustering model when new session data is available.
  3. Regenerates personalized activity recommendations for learners who completed new sessions.
  4. Runs content integrity and compliance validation sweeps.
  5. Executes the Adaptive Content Suggestion Agent to identify curriculum opportunities.
  6. Records a timestamped platform health snapshot.
- **Why it matters:** Features concurrency locking to prevent overlapping executions and wraps each step in independent exception handling so that an issue in one task never halts the rest of the maintenance cycle.

## 🗄️ Production Database Migration Guide

ChildInsight uses **SQLAlchemy** and **Flask-Migrate (Alembic)**, allowing seamless transitions between local SQLite and production databases.

### 1. PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)

#### Step 1: Install Database Driver
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

#### Step 2: Provision Database
Create the target database and user in PostgreSQL:
```sql
CREATE USER childinsight_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_production_password';
CREATE DATABASE childinsight OWNER childinsight_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE childinsight TO childinsight_user;
```

#### Step 3: Update `.env` or Server Environment Variables
```env
FLASK_CONFIG=production
SECRET_KEY=generate_a_64_char_random_hex_string_using_secrets_token_hex
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://childinsight_user:secure_production_password@db-host.internal:5432/childinsight
```
*(Note: ChildInsight's `ProductionConfig` automatically normalizes legacy `postgres://` URLs provided by cloud hosts such as Render and Heroku to standard `postgresql://`).*

#### Step 4: Run Migrations on PostgreSQL
```bash
python -m flask --app run.py db upgrade
```

---

### 2. MySQL (Alternative Production Database)

#### Step 1: Install Database Driver
```bash
pip install pymysql cryptography
```

#### Step 2: Provision Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE childinsight CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'childinsight_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_production_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON childinsight.* TO 'childinsight_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### Step 3: Update `.env` or Server Environment Variables
```env
FLASK_CONFIG=production
SECRET_KEY=generate_a_64_char_random_hex_string_using_secrets_token_hex
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://childinsight_user:secure_production_password@db-host.internal:3306/childinsight
```

#### Step 4: Run Migrations on MySQL
```bash
python -m flask --app run.py db upgrade
```

## 💾 Backup & Recovery Procedures

### 1. SQLite (Local / Development)
Because SQLite databases are single files, backups can be created safely using the SQLite backup API or online backup CLI command:

```bash
# Recommended: Online atomic backup
sqlite3 database/childinsight_dev.db ".backup database/backups/childinsight_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db"

# Direct file copy (ensure server is stopped or idle)
cp database/childinsight_dev.db database/backups/childinsight_dev.bak
```

### 2. PostgreSQL (Production)
Execute a consistent binary dump using `pg_dump`:

```bash
# Create timestamped dump
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d childinsight -F c -b -v -f /var/backups/childinsight_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump

# Restore from dump
pg_restore -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d childinsight -v /var/backups/childinsight_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.dump
```

### 3. MySQL (Production)
Execute a logical backup using `mysqldump`:

```bash
# Create compressed SQL dump
mysqldump -h $DB_HOST -u $DB_USER -p --single-transaction --quick childinsight > /var/backups/childinsight_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Restore from SQL dump
mysql -h $DB_HOST -u $DB_USER -p childinsight < /var/backups/childinsight_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql
```

### Automated Backup Recommendation
In production, schedule daily automated backups via `cron` or cloud provider managed snapshots (e.g. AWS RDS snapshots, Render automated daily backups, DigitalOcean Managed Database backups) with offsite retention.

---

## 🔒 Production Deployment & HTTPS Setup

### 1. Security Configuration Highlights
When running with `FLASK_CONFIG=production`:
- `DEBUG = False` and `TESTING = False`.
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` (cookies transmitted strictly over HTTPS).
- `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True` (prevents JavaScript access to session tokens).
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'` (CSRF defense).
- `REMEMBER_COOKIE_SECURE = True` and `REMEMBER_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True`.
- `ProxyFix` WSGI middleware enabled to parse upstream `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers.
- Strict startup validation requiring strong `SECRET_KEY` and explicit `DATABASE_URL`.

### 2. Deploying with Gunicorn & Nginx on Linux VM

#### Step 1: Install Gunicorn
```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

#### Step 2: Systemd Service Unit (`/etc/systemd/system/childinsight.service`)
```ini
[Unit]
Description=ChildInsight Gunicorn Application
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
Group=www-data

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### Step 3: Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/childinsight`)
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.childinsight.org;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;

        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Obtain Free TLS Certificate (Certbot)
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d app.childinsight.org
```

### 3. Cloud PaaS Deployment (Render / Railway / Fly.io)
1. Configure environment variables in the provider dashboard:
   - `FLASK_CONFIG`: `production`
   - `SECRET_KEY`: `<generated-random-secret>`
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Linked from provider's managed PostgreSQL database.
2. Build Command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m flask --app run.py db upgrade
   ```
3. Start Command:
   ```bash
   gunicorn run:app
   ```
*(TLS certificates and HTTPS termination are automatically provisioned and managed by the PaaS provider).*

## 📜 Production Logging Standards

ChildInsight uses standard library rotating file logs (`RotatingFileHandler`):
- **Location:** `logs/childinsight.log`
- **File Rotation:** 10MB file size threshold with 5 backup archives retained.
- **Scrubbing Policy:** Passwords, plain text authentication tokens, and raw session cookie payloads are strictly prohibited from logs. Route error handlers capture only sanitized route, method, user ID, and stack trace metadata.
